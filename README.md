# Qwen UI pipeline

A reference-preserving UI workflow built around Qwen Image 3 Pro, ComfyUI,
Figma/FigJam, and deterministic application code.

## Current machine setup

- ComfyUI `0.31.0` runs as the enabled user service `qwen-comfyui.service`.
- The local UI/API is `http://10.255.255.254:8188` on this WSL host.
- `Qwen Image 3 Render` calls the provider API without exposing keys in a
  workflow.
- `Reference Region Composite` restores the immutable reference outside an
  explicit `x,y,width,height` region.
- `comfyui-mcp` `0.50.98` is registered as the `comfyui` Codex MCP server.
- OpenRouter and Alibaba keys are injected from Bitwarden Secrets Manager by
  the service wrapper; they are not stored in this repository.

Sanitized copies of the service unit, secret-injection wrapper, and Codex MCP
registration live in [`deploy/`](deploy/README.md) so the host setup can be
recreated without copying credentials.

Check the service and API:

```bash
systemctl --user status qwen-comfyui.service
curl -fsS http://10.255.255.254:8188/system_stats
```

The MCP registration becomes available automatically in a new Codex session.
No ComfyUI API key is required while the service remains bound to the local WSL
loopback alias.

## Pipeline

1. Preserve a Reference Screen and checksum it.
2. Describe one controlled change as an Edit Brief.
3. Compile the brief into ordered instruction blocks within Qwen Image 3's
   approximate 4.5K-token image-instruction budget.
4. Run a fixed-seed Render Pass through ComfyUI.
5. Compare the batch and retain provenance for the selected output.
6. For strict preservation, composite only the approved region onto a
   lossless PNG reference.
7. Upload contact sheets and approved outputs to FigJam without replacing the
   source.
8. Rebuild labels, layout, controls, and animation as native Figma and web
   elements.

## Exact interactive GolfStudio prototype

The current deliverable is the separate Figma Design file
[GolfStudio Exact Interactive Replica — v002](https://www.figma.com/design/TWPIEIOVyLjDEnlzWLcnIw).
Open `03 Exact Prototype`, select Address (`7:2`), and present the
`GolfStudio Exact Swing Sequence` flow. The four 474×403 states preserve the
approved Assembly rather than reconstructing its Windows chrome. Exact-position
transport and timeline hotspots provide the interactions, while `02 Exact
Components` contains reusable raster state variants and the hotspot component.

The earlier v001 file is superseded: it matched the canvas dimensions but
redrew the entire interface, producing normalized RMSE 0.313 and changing every
pixel. v002 instead gates fidelity with a browser screenshot test that requires
zero changed pixels outside declared golf text, graph, and club-motion regions.

The working hybrid Interactive Replica is in [`web/`](web/). Run and test it with:

```bash
npm --prefix web test
npm --prefix web run serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`. The range input, transport controls, Space
key, and arrow keys are functional. The approved v003 Assembly is the visible
baseline. Club motion uses a deterministic clean plate and isolated club sprite;
controls are accessible DOM hit targets aligned over exact source pixels.

Extract exact reusable source components through ComfyUI without redrawing
their small text or borders:

```bash
python3 -m qwen_ui_pipeline component-workflow \
  --reference-filename golfstudio-approved-baseline.png \
  --components examples/golfstudio-reference-components-v001.json \
  --filename-prefix golf-ui/reference-components/v001 \
  --output workflows/golfstudio-reference-components-v001.api.json
```

Compile and inspect a brief:

```bash
python3 -m qwen_ui_pipeline compile examples/golf-club-object-v002.json --json
```

Generate the ComfyUI API graph:

```bash
python3 -m qwen_ui_pipeline workflow \
  examples/golf-club-object-v002.json \
  --reference-filename plantstudio-main-window.gif \
  --filename-prefix golf-ui/club-preview/v002 \
  --output workflows/golf-club-object-v002.api.json
```

Generate a deterministic assembly graph:

```bash
python3 -m qwen_ui_pipeline assembly-workflow \
  --reference-filename plantstudio-main-window.png \
  --generated-filename golf-club-v002-2.png \
  --region 182,78,37,165 \
  --filename-prefix golf-ui/club-assembly/v003 \
  --output workflows/golf-club-assembly-v003.api.json
```

`provider: auto` tries OpenRouter first. It falls back to direct Alibaba only
for OpenRouter's pre-generation privacy/guardrail rejection, not after a
timeout or ambiguous error that could create duplicate billing.

## First golf test

- v001 proved the complete provider-to-ComfyUI path, but its forced 4:3 output
  stretched the source.
- v002 used Alibaba's explicit `948*806` source-ratio output. Variant 2 was the
  strongest donor image.
- v003 composites only the 37×165 selected region at source resolution. Its
  measured absolute error outside that region is zero pixels.
- FigJam nodes `4:146`, `4:147`, and `6:146` contain the selected v002 render,
  its contact sheet, and the exact-preservation v003 assembly respectively.

See [the run evaluation](docs/runs/golf-club-object-v001-v003.md) and
[the prompting method](docs/research/qwen-image-3-prompt-method.md). The final
Figma-to-code handoff and verification record is in
[the exact interactive prototype run](docs/runs/golfstudio-exact-interactive-v002.md).
